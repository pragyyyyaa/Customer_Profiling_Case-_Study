# Customer Profiling & Targeted Marketing Strategy

A data-driven customer segmentation and campaign response analysis project aimed at identifying high-value customers and designing targeted marketing strategies using machine learning and behavioral analytics.

## Project Overview
Customer profiling helps businesses understand who their customers are, how they behave, and how they respond to marketing campaigns.  
This project applies feature engineering, predictive modeling, PCA, and clustering to create actionable customer segments.

## Business Objectives
- Improve targeting of marketing campaigns  
- Identify high-value customer groups  
- Predict customer responsiveness  
- Segment customers into actionable clusters  
- Design segment-specific marketing strategies  

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- Demographics (Age, Education, Marital Status, Income)
- Purchase behavior (category-wise spend, channels)
- Campaign responses
- Engagement metrics (web visits, recency, tenure)

## Methodology
1. Data cleaning & preprocessing  
2. Feature engineering  
3. Logistic regression for campaign response prediction  
4. PCA for dimensionality reduction  
5. K-Means clustering for customer segmentation  

## Customer Segments
- **Budget Browsers**: Price-sensitive, deal-driven, high web activity  
- **Elite Engaged Buyers**: High spenders, strong campaign response, premium buyers  

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- SHAP
- Streamlit (optional extension)
